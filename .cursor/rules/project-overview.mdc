- **Canvas-based rendering** for the falling words animation
- **Responsive design** with mobile considerations

## Key Features
- Real-time typing speed (WPM) calculation
- Accuracy tracking and statistics
- Canvas-based falling word animation
- Modern glassmorphism UI design
- SEO-optimized with proper meta tags
