# Game Mechanics Documentation

## Core Game Loop
The typing game in [index.html](mdc:index.html) follows this main cycle:

### 1. Word Generation System
- **Random word selection** from predefined word lists
- **Difficulty scaling**: Longer words and faster speeds over time
- **Spawn timing**: Controlled intervals with randomization
- **Word positioning**: Random X coordinates, start from top

### 2. Falling Animation System
- **Physics simulation**: Constant downward velocity
- **Canvas rendering**: 60fps animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- **Collision detection**: Word reaching bottom boundary
- **Visual effects**: Particle systems and gradient animations

### 3. Input Processing
- **Real-time typing detection**: Keypress event handling
- **Partial matching**: Progressive word completion tracking
- **Case sensitivity**: Configurable matching rules
- **Input validation**: Filter special characters and handle backspace

### 4. Scoring System
- **WPM calculation**: Words per minute based on correct characters
- **Accuracy tracking**: Percentage of successful word catches
- **Combo system**: Consecutive successful catches for bonus points
- **Statistics**: Real-time display of current performance

## Game Features

### Visual Design Elements
- **Cyberpunk aesthetic**: Neon blues and electric color scheme
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Transparent panels with backdrop blur
- **Particle effects**: Dynamic background animations
- **Responsive feedback**: Visual cues for player actions

### User Experience Features
- **Progressive difficulty**: Game speeds up as player improves
- **Real-time statistics**: Live WPM and accuracy display
- **Game state management**: Start, pause, game over screens
- **Sound effects**: Audio feedback for game events (when implemented)

### Performance Features
- **Optimized rendering**: Efficient canvas operations
- **Memory management**: Object pooling for word instances
- **Smooth animations**: 60fps target with performance monitoring
- **Responsive design**: Scales across different screen sizes

## Configuration Options
- **Difficulty levels**: Adjustable word speed and complexity
- **Word lists**: Customizable vocabulary sets
- **Game duration**: Configurable session lengths
- **Visual themes**: Potential for multiple color schemes
